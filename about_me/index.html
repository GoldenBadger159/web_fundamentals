                Currently I am on my second semester here at BYU-I as a Software Engineering Major.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got married to my wonderful wife last December. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning about web design would set me up for more opportunities in front end development as
            </p>
            <p>
                an internship or entry level position for a future career, which will help lead me to a great job
            </p>
            <p>
                within the software development environment.
