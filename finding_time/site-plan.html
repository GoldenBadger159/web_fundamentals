      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Every college friend group has one thing in common;
 It's a pain in the rear to schedule a time where everyone in the group
 can meet up around their diverse schedules. With the use of my website
 groups will be able to fill out a personal calendar and submit it to the
 group page which will then for a consensus of times where everyone is available.
 This will help expedite event planning and becomes more effective the larger your group.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>About Finding Time/Why us</h3>
      <p>
        Many friend groups struggle against a common enemy: scheduling. Our founders dealt with all 
        the same struggles in collaboration between study groups, scheduling game nights, and even 
        finding time to spend with the in laws. 
        That's why we came up with the idea of Finding Time. to make that process far less painful 
        for our users. 
        We offer a unique perspective on comparing calendars with many options for anonymity which may
        decrease animosity. using our software will grant flexibility and consistency to friend groups 
        all over the world.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        How do I use the site?
        Our webpage will provide all resources needed to complete seamless collaboration. 
        One member of the group will need to register a free account with Finding Time to create an event 
        proposition. They will be able to add a brief overview of the activity, a time frame length, 
        and a host location schedule if necessary. From there the host will fill out their availability and will 
        be given a link to send to the other members. Each of the members in the group need simply to follow the 
        link, enter their phone number to be notified when a time is chosen, and fill out their availability. 
        That's all. The rest is handled by our system which will compare the availability of each member in 
        intervals as accurate as fifteen minutes and highlight periods inn a scale from red to green with red being 
        less than 20% of the members available and green being 100%. The registered member needs only to check for the 
        colors matching the desired turn out and select the time to notify each member via text message. 

        Are there constraints on where we can host the event?
        By adding a location in the description of your event you can upload scheduling for the building as 
        well as for each party member. So long as you have internet access any host location is more than viable 
        to schedule with our software.

        How long does it take to schedule an event?
        Being able to schedule last minute as well as months in advance are both very important and incredibly crucial 
        aspects we work to integrate into our system. Meaning you can use our resources anytime. Simply follow the link 
        provided by a registered member to fill out your availability when you have the time, and no worries, you can 
        always come back and update it later. As soon as everyone has added their availability the results should be ready 
        to view for the host.

        What does your software do?
        We strive to create a seamless integration of complex schedules and availability gathered from many peoples 
        into one collective calendar for the group to decide more efficiently when all or most of the group can attend 
        various activities providing an easy workaround for scheduling conflicts.
