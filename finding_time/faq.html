                How do I use the site?
                <h4 class="answer">
                    Our webpage will provide all resources needed to complete seamless collaboration. 
                    One member of the group will need to register a free account with Finding Time to create an event 
                    proposition. They will be able to add a brief overview of the activity, a time frame length, 
                    and a host location schedule if necessary. From there the host will fill out their availability and will 
                    be given a link to send to the other members. Each of the members in the group need simply to follow the 
                    link, enter their phone number to be notified when a time is chosen, and fill out their availability. 
                    That's all. The rest is handled by our system which will compare the availability of each member in 
                    intervals as accurate as fifteen minutes and highlight periods inn a scale from red to green with red being 
                    less than 20% of the members available and green being 100%. The registered member needs only to check for the 
                    colors matching the desired turn out and select the time to notify each member via text message.

                Are there constraints on where we can host the event? 
                <h4 class="answer">
                    By adding a location in the description of your event you can upload scheduling for the building as 
                    well as for each party member. So long as you have internet access any host location is more than viable 
                    to schedule with our software.

                How long does it take to schedule an event?
                <h4 class="answer">
                    Being able to schedule last minute as well as months in advance are both very important and incredibly crucial 
                    aspects we work to integrate into our system. Meaning you can use our resources anytime. Simply follow the link 
                    provided by a registered member to fill out your availability when you have the time, and no worries, you can 
                    always come back and update it later. As soon as everyone has added their availability the results should be ready 
                    to view for the host.

                <h4 class="answer">
                    We strive to create a seamless integration of complex schedules and availability gathered from many peoples 
                    into one collective calendar for the group to decide more efficiently when all or most of the group can attend 
                    various activities providing an easy workaround for scheduling conflicts.
